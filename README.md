# Scientific_Calculator_project6

Solo project: Build a Calculator without the use of 'Eval' in python.

## My_work

We discovered python from scratch 2 days before and then we had 3 days to create this small calculator.
The main goal was to handle the logic of the calculation process without 'Eval'.

Meaning handling the parenthesis, multiplier and also negative numbers.

Not the funniest project but it was quite challenging.
